## Project Overview

This repository contains the detailed vulnerability assessment report for the web application [ginandjuice.shop](https://ginandjuice.shop). The assessment focuses on identifying and addressing critical security issues, including SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities, and more.

---

## Scope

The assessment was conducted on the following components:  
- Website: [ginandjuice.shop](https://ginandjuice.shop)  
- Objective: Web application vulnerability analysis.  
- Key Vulnerabilities:
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)
  - Reflected XSS
  - Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI)
  - Clickjacking
  - XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  - URL Override Exploitation

---

## Tools & Methodology

### Tools Used
- Manual Testing: Including specially crafted HTTP requests.  
- Burp Suite: For intercepting and crafting payloads.  
- Custom Payloads: Based on open-source repositories like [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz).

### Testing Methodology
1. Identification of vulnerable endpoints.  
2. Payload crafting and injection.  
3. Reproduction and validation of exploits.  
4. Impact analysis and documentation.

## Summary of Findings

| Vulnerability                | Risk Level | Affected Endpoint                          |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Client-Side Template Injection    | High           | `/blog/?search=<payload>`                     |
| Reflected XSS                     | High           | `/login`, `/catalog?searchTerm=<payload>`     |
| SQL Injection                     | Critical       | `/catalog?searchTerm=<payload>`               |
| URL Override Vulnerability        | Medium         | `/blog/post?postId=2&ehj35osewk=1`           |
| XML External Entity (XXE)         | Critical       | `/catalog/product/stock`                      |
| Clickjacking                      | High           | `/blog`                                       |

## Key Recommendations

### General
- Sanitize and validate user inputs.  
- Use prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection.  
- Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).  
- Use safe templating engines for client-side code.

### Specific Fixes
1. SQL Injection: Implement parameterized queries.  
2. XSS: Escape output and enforce strong CSP headers.  
3. XXE: Disable external entity processing in XML parsers.  
4. Clickjacking: Use `X-Frame-Options` headers.  
5. URL Override: Restrict and validate URL headers.
